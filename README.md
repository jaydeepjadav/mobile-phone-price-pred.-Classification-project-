# Nairobi public transport Regression project
## INSTRUCTIONS
### Problem Statement
This challenge asked me to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this dataset. All of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

The towns from which these routes originate are:

Awendo

Homa Bay

Kehancha

Kendu Bay

Keroka

Keumbu

Kijauri

Kisii

Mbita

Migori

Ndhiwa

Nyachenge

Oyugis

Rodi

Rongo

Sirare

Sori

Passengers of these bus (or shuttle) rides are affected by Nairobi traffic not only during their ride into the city, but from there they must continue their journey to their final destination in Nairobi wherever that may be. Traffic can act as a deterrent for those who have the option to avoid buses that arrive in Nairobi during peak traffic hours. On the other hand, traffic may be an indication for peopleâ€™s movement patterns, reflecting business hours, cultural events, political events, and holidays.

### DATASET INFORMATION
I have made project on Public transportation system of Nairobi on the basis of pre-stored data, if a person wants to invest or starts his/her business in public transport ticket market this project will mainly helps in getting better sales result regarding tickets. Here is the link to dataset which was used

### Graphs
These are few of the charts from this project. In the chart below we can see the difference in the ratio of shuttle and bus, both of them have near about same proportions with respect to  tickets sold.

With next chart we get idea that how much public transport is active in which city in terms of tickets sold. Kisii, Rango, Kijauri have most of the market, that is most no. public transport users travel to Nairobi are from these cities and even among them Kisii have exponentially larger crowd than any other origin.

From the above charts we got the idea which type of transport is used how much and second which cities have seen most no. Of tickets sold. But from the next chart we can have a more detailed understanding of which type of transport is mostly used in which city.
From this chart we can easily conclude shuttles are not widely used in all cities but only in a few places, for example- Kisii have sold most number of tickets amongst all cities but of shuttles and due to that we can see buses and shuttles have near about the same proportion in the ticket market. From this we can say that Kisii alone is almost manipulating the charts. Whereas proportion of bus tickets are distributed between all other cities.

And in this last chart we can get a brief idea that in which month of the year how much tickets were sold or which months are best months for tickets market.
