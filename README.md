# Nairobi public transport Regression project
## INSTRUCTIONS
### Problem Statement
This challenge asked me to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this dataset. All of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

The towns from which these routes originate are:

Awendo

Homa Bay

Kehancha

Kendu Bay

Keroka

Keumbu

Kijauri

Kisii

Mbita

Migori

Ndhiwa

Nyachenge

Oyugis

Rodi

Rongo

Sirare

Sori

Passengers of these bus (or shuttle) rides are affected by Nairobi traffic not only during their ride into the city, but from there they must continue their journey to their final destination in Nairobi wherever that may be. Traffic can act as a deterrent for those who have the option to avoid buses that arrive in Nairobi during peak traffic hours. On the other hand, traffic may be an indication for peopleâ€™s movement patterns, reflecting business hours, cultural events, political events, and holidays.

### DATASET INFORMATION
